check_docs.py — cheap doc-staleness guard for lean-pde-notes (notes#71).

lean-pde-notes went stale before: root README claimed "1,413 declarations" and site/README
claimed "1,412" while the actual extracted universe had already moved to 1,349, then 1,339;
a collision count of "8 groups / 16 decls" lingered long after cleanup left only 2/4. Those
numbers are *generated facts* (from extracted/decls.json), not editorial content, so hand-
maintained prose in "living" docs (docs that describe the *current* pipeline/state) should
never embed them as a literal digit — it should point at the generator instead
(`extracted/decls.json`, `scripts/coverage.py`, `scripts/validate.py`, ...).

This script does NOT try to recompute "the right number" and diff it against prose (too
fragile — reformats, footnotes, and legitimate small numbers like "2 capstones" would false-
positive constantly). Instead it enforces the structural fix: living docs must not contain a
declaration/collision-count-shaped number at all. Historical/migration logs are exempt by
design — they are dated snapshots and are expected to carry point-in-time numbers.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check_docs.py
